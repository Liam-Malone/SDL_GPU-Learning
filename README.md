# SDL_GPU Learning

Learning how to write a basic renderer on top of SDL3's SDL_gpu API.

This will hopefully be the renderer that gets used in GAME (My game project, yet-to-be-titled). For now that project remains on the standard SDL3 SDL_Renderer (built for OpenGL backend), but hopefully I can progress this renderer and get it to a good enough stage to not have to deal with that dual-state management nightmare.

## Resources

- Will largely be referencing the [SDL_gpu_examples](https://github.com/TheSpydog/SDL_gpu_examples).

- I will likely also pull on the LearnOpenGL book, and maybe some of XorDev's shader posts.
